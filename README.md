This repository demonstrates a common yet cryptic error in React Native development: library incompatibility issues.  The error often manifests as vague runtime errors, making debugging difficult. The example uses a hypothetical library with version mismatches, causing unexpected behavior. The solution involves updating the library to a version compatible with your React Native environment and ensuring consistent data types are used.
