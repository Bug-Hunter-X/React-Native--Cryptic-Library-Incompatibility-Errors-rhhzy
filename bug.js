This error occurs when you are using a library that is not compatible with React Native's older version or when there are inconsistencies in the library's implementation. For instance, if the library uses a function that is not supported in your current React Native version or if there is a mismatch in the expected data types used in the library functions, you will encounter this issue. You might see errors related to missing modules, incorrect module imports, or runtime errors that stem from the incompatibility of the library you're using. The error messages are usually cryptic and might not explicitly mention the version incompatibility.
