The solution involves updating the library to a compatible version or finding an alternative that works seamlessly with your React Native setup. In this instance, let's assume updating the library resolves the issue.  You should also carefully review the library's documentation to ensure the correct usage and data types.  Make sure that all data types match the types expected in the functions you are using from the external library. Check the library's version compatibility with your React Native version. Using a version manager for npm (like npm-check-updates) or yarn (like yarn upgrade-interactive) can help avoid version conflicts.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import {View, Text} from 'react-native';
import updatedLibrary from 'updated-library'; // Updated version of the library

const MyComponent = () => {
  const data = {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30,
  };

  try {
    const result = updatedLibrary.process(data);  // Correct data type passed
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{result}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  } catch (error) {
    return <Text>Error: {error.message}</Text>;
  }
};

export default MyComponent;
```
